\paragraph{May 8, Janne Spijkervet}
Tim Muller joined the team. All packages needed to develop for the robots were installed on his computer.

\paragraph{May 16, Janne Spijkervet}
Chris Al Gerges, Mirka Schouten and Charlotte Kaandorp joined the team. I ran through all the installation instructions with them in the robotlab to make sure their computers were ready for developing in our framework (ROS) and the Pepper robot. I also gave them a quick introduction into publisher/subscriber node,s topics, data structures and writing a first Hello World program for the Pepper robot (including an example with head/hand sensors).

\paragraph{May 16, Janne Spijkervet}
A new script has been added to the uva-robotics repository to run ROS with multiple machines. This involved setting the ROS\_MASTER\_URI, ROS\_IP environment variables to that of the ROS core machine and the child machine.
